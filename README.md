# Programmes to improve architectural work

This repository is a storage for old programmes that I built to improve my productivity at work as well as practicing coding. There are programmes written in Python, Excel spreadsheets written in Visual Basic, and Dynamo files for Revit Dynamo.

1. <strong>CCC check process</strong><br/>A single PDF file that was created to simplify and speed up the checking process for district plan requirements for two industrial zones. This helped reducing checking time for local authorityâ€™s requirements.

2. <strong>Excel macro</strong><br/>Visual Basic codes for Excel spreadsheets. This was created to improve productivity on administrative work for the old office. Project budget managing file was created in request from managers.

3. <strong>Renaming PDF to office standard</strong><br/>Renaming PDF drawings with current revisions extracting the correct information from Revit through Dynamo.This project was to practice Python os module and GUI library - PyQt.

4. <strong>Revit Dynamo</strong><br/>Dynamo programs were created to improve productivity in line with using Revit. Dynamo also allows users to code with Python 2.7.

5. <strong>Time manager</strong><br/>These programs were created to record working time on a project and analyse my own time. Working on this program, I was able to improve understanding of database structure and manipulating Excel files from Python. This program also provided a weekly timesheet which had to be filled in hand otherwise.
